## Homizon Project â€“ Process Log

This document tracks all changes, fixes, and deployment-related actions performed on the project. I will continue appending to this file with each change going forward.

### 2025-09-04

- Repository setup and initial sync
  - Initialized git repository on branch `main`.
  - Configured remote: `origin` -> `https://github.com/syed-c/homizon.git`.
  - Staged all files and created initial commit.
  - Pushed to `origin/main`.

- Vercel build fix: RSC (`"use client"`) vs metadata conflicts
  - Removed `"use client"` from pages exporting `metadata` as required by Next.js App Router.
  - Files adjusted:
    - `app/about/page.tsx`: removed `"use client"`; server component now exports `metadata`.
    - `app/contact/page.tsx`: converted to server component (kept only `metadata` + `ContactPageContent`).
    - `app/services/page.tsx`: converted to server component (kept only `metadata` + `ServicesPageContent`).

- Runtime safety: guard `toLowerCase()` calls
  - Prevented prerender crashes from `undefined.toLowerCase()`.
  - Files adjusted:
    - `app/admin/providers/page.tsx`: filter/search logic now null-safe for name/company/email.
    - `app/sitemap/page.tsx`: search/filter logic now null-safe for service/area/subarea names.

- Admin Providers page data safety
  - Removed unsafe `sampleProviders[1]`/`[2]` references to avoid undefined access during prerender.
  - Added complete mock providers to satisfy `Provider` type and ensure stable export.

- Sitemap page component types
  - Ensured types align with `generateServiceAreaCombinations` return shape.
  - Replaced `Badge` usage with a simple styled element to avoid prop/type mismatch during build.

- Global theme application
  - Applied home-page dark gradient theme globally via `components/conditional-layout.tsx` (site-wide background/text styling). User later simplified layout to render children without global wrapper for admin routes and kept header/footer for public routes.

- Local production build verification
  - Ran `npm run build` locally after fixes; build completed successfully.
  - Confirmed route outputs and page types in the build summary.

### 2025-09-04 (Continued)

- Provider profile page creation
  - Created dynamic provider profile page at `/providers/[providerId]/page.tsx` (Server Component).
  - Created client component `/providers/[providerId]/provider-profile-client.tsx` with tabs for Dashboard, Profile, Services, and Service Locations.
  - Removed edit options and leads section as requested.
  - Applied responsive design with white text and dark theme consistency.

- Supabase integration for provider management
  - Created `lib/supabase.ts` with functions for provider CRUD operations.
