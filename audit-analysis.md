### Service Pages Status
**Current service directories:** 17 service directories exist
- Most are individual services (ac-cleaning, ac-repair, etc.)
- Missing general service category pages

### Key Gaps Identified:
1. **Service slug mismatches** - need to align with required naming
2. **Missing service category pages** - need /services/<category-slug>/
3. **Missing individual service pages** - need /services/<service-slug>/
4. **Missing areas** - need to add ~8 missing areas
5. **Service×Area combinations** - need systematic verification
6. **Sub-area pages** - need verification of all sub-area pages

## Next Steps:
1. Update service slugs to match requirements
2. Create missing service pages
3. Add missing areas
4. Verify all service×area combinations
5. Check sub-area pages
6. Update navigation and sitemap
